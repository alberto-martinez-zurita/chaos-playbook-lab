petstore_tools.py - Auto-generated tool wrappers for Petstore API

PURPOSE:
    Each function wraps a Petstore API endpoint and can be used as an ADK tool.
    The actual implementation calls chaos_agent which may inject controlled failures.

USAGE:
    from chaos_playbook_engine.tools.petstore_tools import addPet, getPetById
    
    # These functions will be connected to chaos_agent in the actual implementation
    result = addPet(name="doggie", status="available")
